# AdbOverTcp

This project is a utility just for testing.

As the device used by us is a non-rmnet device which even dont have a usb interface, I need to debug an app on the device via tcp.
Before I use wifi to accomplish this case, but the transimission speed over wifi is so slow that I cant endure. 
The device has an ethernet interface, so I try to fecth the prop and set it by this project.
